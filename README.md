<ul>
    <li>Create a modern and captivating design to give a modernization to the classic version of minesweeper that we all know</li>
    <li>Apply and concretely study concepts such as recursion, application of different graphic styles and basic navigation in a responsive site</li>
</ul>

<h3>:memo: - Rules of the game</h3>
<div><strong>The objective of the game is to find all the mines hidden in the field and mark them with a flag</strong></div>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>In the main screen you can select the number of columns and rows of the playing field (with the possibility of making it square)</li>
    <li>By changing the difficulty, the number of mines hidden in the field will increase or decrease accordingly</li>
    <li>
        Once you click on a square without selecting the "flagging" option, one of two situations can occur
        <ul>
        <li>
            If there is no mine, the box will show a number indicating the number of mines present in its immediate vicinity (in a 3x3 square, with the clicked cell in the center)
        </li>
        <li>
            If there is a mine, the game will end by revealing the location of all mines on the field
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If the "flagging" option is selected, the cell turns gray and will show a flag icon, symbolizing the fact that we believe there is a mine there
    </li>
</ul>
